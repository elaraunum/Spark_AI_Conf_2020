This included a technique known as batch normalization.\n\nEach layer in a deep neural network (with 10+ layers, for instance) expects the inputs from the previous layer to come from the same distribution.  However, in practice each layer is being updated, changing the distribution of its output to the next layer.  This is called \"internal covariate shift\" and can result in an unstable learning process since each layer is effectively learning a moving target. \n\n**Batch normalization is a technique that applies to very deep neural networks (especially CNNs) that standardizes the inputs to a layer for each mini-batch.** Generally speaking, this reduces the number of training epochs needed by stabilizing the learning process.\n\nBatch normalization should generally not be used with dropout, another regularization technique discussed in the Advanced Keras notebook.  While there's some contention over which is a more effective method ([see this paper for details](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-019-08453-9)), batch normalization is generally preferred over dropout for deep neural networks."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from tensorflow.keras.applications.inception_v3 import InceptionV3\n\ninceptionModel = InceptionV3()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Take a look at the architecture noted where batch normalization is performed."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["inceptionModel.summary()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":12},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Looking for more reference architectures?

However, if your model is very large, then there is high overhead for the Pandas UDF to repeatedly load the same model for every batch in the same Python worker process. In Spark 3.0, Pandas UDFs can accept an iterator of pandas.Series or pandas.DataFrame so that you can load the model only once instead of loading it for every series in the iterator.\n\nThis way the cost of any set-up needed (like loading the VGG16 model in our case) will be incurred fewer times. When the number of images you’re working with is greater than `spark.conf.get('spark.sql.execution.arrow.maxRecordsPerBatch')`, which is 10,000 by default, you'll see significant speed ups over a pandas scalar UDF because it iterates through batches of pd.Series.\n\nIt has the general syntax of: \n```@pandas_udf(...)\ndef predict(iterator):\n  model = ... # load model\n  for features in batch_iter:\n    yield model.predict(features)```\n\n\n<img alt=\"Side Note\" title=\"Side Note\" style=\"vertical-align: text-bottom; position: relative; height:1.75em; top:0.05em; transform:rotate(15deg)\" src=\"https://files.training.databricks.com/static/images/icon-note.webp\"/> If the workers cached the model weights after loading it for the first time, subsequent calls of the same UDF with the same model loading will become significantly faster."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf\nfrom typing import Iterator\n\ndef preprocess(image_path):\n  path = image_path.replace(\"dbfs:\", \"/dbfs\")\n  img = image.load_img(path, target_size=(224, 224))\n  x = image.img_to_array(img)\n  x = preprocess_input(x)\n  return x\n\n@pandas_udf(ArrayType(StringType()))\ndef vgg16_predict_pandas_udf(image_data_iter: Iterator[pd.DataFrame]) -> Iterator[pd.DataFrame]:\n  # Load model outside of for loop\n  model = VGG16(weights=\"imagenet\") \n  for image_data_series in image_data_iter:\n    image_path_series = image_data_series[\"origin\"]\n    # Apply functions to entire series at once\n    x = image_path_series.map(preprocess) \n    x = np.stack(list(x.values))\n    preds = model.predict(x, batch_size=6)\n    top_3s = decode_predictions(preds, top=3)\n    \n    # Format results\n    results = []\n    for top_3 in top_3s:\n      result = []\n      for _, label, prob in top_3:\n        result.append(f\"{label}: {prob:.3f}\")\n      results.append(result)\n    yield pd.Series(results)\n\ndisplay(df.withColumn(\"Top 3 VGG16 Predictions (pandas udf)\", vgg16_predict_pandas_udf(\"image\")))"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":27},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Yikes!
